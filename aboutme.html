<tab1> As an undergraduate Engineering Student at Rutgers University, I have balanced both rigorous coursework and multiple extracurricular activities which have helped augment my skills relevant to this position. As an information technology assistant at Rutgers School of Socialwork, I work with a team of six students to assist over five hundred faculties and staff. I have taken classes such as Software Engineering, Cloud Computing, Data structures, computer architecture and systems programming which has helped me develop excellent programming skills. I currently work with three programming languages and in the process of building my own android application. In addition, I have also developed good communication skill by working as a bartender/barback off campus.
